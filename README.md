## Assignment 1 Baudet Quentin

### Project Name : _Tipax_

* **Goal**

  This project aims to solve the issue of having to always anticipate the result of the check when eating at a restaurant. You always need to imagine that the check will be about 30% higher than the simple sum of the meals you take, and these calculations can be both inaccurate and bothersome.

* **Features**

  The website will allow the user to _view the final price of his ckeck_ by letting him enter his city (ideally an API would fetch the tax rate) and the tip amount.  
  The website will also allow groups to _split the check_ at their convenience and thus easily get an equal price for everyone.
