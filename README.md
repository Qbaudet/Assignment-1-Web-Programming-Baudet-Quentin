# Project Name : _Tipax_
##### Idea by BAUDET Quentin
##### By BAUDET Quentin, DUPONT Nicolas, BEZOT Maxime

* **Goal**

  This project aims to solve the issue of having to always anticipate the **result of the check** when eating at a restaurant. You always need to imagine that the check will be about 30% higher than the simple sum of the meals you take, and these calculations can be both inaccurate and bothersome.

* **Features**

  The website will allow the user to _view the total price of his ckecks_ by letting him enter his city's tax rate and the tip amount. 
  All of these checks can be stored on the users demand and can be viewed at any time, including the details of the check, at which restaurant was it and other information.
  Finally, the user can also view a list of the restaurants he's been to by entering them.

* **Tools**

  This project uses the following tools : 
  * HTML
  * CSS 
  * JS
  * Bootstrap (for the front-end) 
  * NodeJS
  * Knex
  * PostgreSQL Database
