##### Idea by BAUDET Quentin
##### By BAUDET Quentin, DUPONT Nicolas, BEZOT Maxime

* **Goal**

  This project aims to solve the issue of having to always anticipate the **result of the check** when eating at a restaurant. You always need to imagine that the check will be about 30% higher than the simple sum of the meals you take, and these calculations can be both inaccurate and bothersome.

* **Features**

  The website will allow the user to _view the final price of his ckeck_ by letting him enter his city taxes and the tip amount.  
  It will allow to see the history the user checks. And also display a list of restaurants to register the meals avaiable there 

* **Tools**

  This project use 
  * HTML
  * CSS 
  * JS
  * Bootstrap (for the front-end) 
  * NodeJS
  * Knex
  * Postgre Database
